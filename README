File-TTX

File::TTX is a utility module for reading and writing the TTX files used by the TRADOS tools for translation of natural
language text.  It provides access methods for the header data and several ways of reading and building body content.

You do not need TRADOS installed to use this module; it works entirely by direct access of the file content.  (Which is easier
than you'd think; it's just XML inside.)
